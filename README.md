## Snake Game
##### About the Game
<p>The Snake Game is a classic and popular computer game. In this game, the player controls the snake with the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player attempts to eat the food displayed on the screen by controlling the snake to run into the food with the head of the snake. Each food eaten makes the snake longer, which makes controlling the snake progressively more difficult. The player loses when the snake head runs into the screen border, itselt or an obstacle.</p>

<p>This version of the Snake Game is simple yet challenging, designed to keep you engaged for hours. It features smooth gameplay and easy controls making it a perfect pastime for those who want to challenge their reflexes and timing skills. Enjoy the game and aim for the high score!</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to refactor the source code for the snake game to improve the maintainability, readability and also ensure new functionality can be added to the source code without breaking the game.</p>
